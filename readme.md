ECMP (Equal Cost Multipath Routing)
Overview
This repository explores the implementation of Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing within programmable data planes. Leveraging technologies such as P4 (Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors), we aim to enhance the dynamic and flexible control of network traffic flow through advanced routing techniques.

Key Features
Dynamic Path Selection: Adapt path selection criteria based on real-time network conditions or performance metrics to optimize routing decisions.
Advanced Hash-Based Load Balancing: Utilize sophisticated hashing techniques to distribute traffic more evenly across available paths, reducing bottlenecks and improving overall network efficiency.
Real-Time Telemetry Integration: Combine real-time telemetry data to make more informed routing decisions, enhancing efficiency and reducing latency.
Adaptive Policy Configuration: Dynamically modify routing policies based on predefined scenarios, such as changes in traffic patterns or service priorities, supporting smarter and more efficient network operations.
Objective
The main goal of this repository is to demonstrate how ECMP can be implemented in programmable data planes to create a more adaptive, responsive, and efficient network infrastructure. By programming the data plane, we can respond to changing network conditions in real-time, improving traffic management and network reliability.

Technologies
P4 Language: Utilized for programming packet-forwarding decisions in data plane devices independent of the underlying hardware.
Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Whether it's adding new features, improving existing ones, or reporting bugs, feel free to fork this repository and submit your pull requests. We are particularly interested in extending the capability of ECMP strategies and integrating with different network telemetry tools.
